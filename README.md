Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, I delve into analyzing sales
data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, I aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of [insert number] rows of data, representing Amazon
sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.
## Analysis Questions Resolved
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:
1. What are the total sales made by each customer?
2. How many unique customers have placed orders?
3. Which product has the highest sale price?
4. How many orders were placed in each state?
5. What is the total revenue generated from each product category?
6. Which seller has the highest total sales?
7. What is the average quantity of products ordered per order?
8. Which customer has made the highest total purchase?
9. How many returns were made for each order?
10. What is the total sales revenue generated per month?
11. Which product category has the highest average sale price?
12. How many orders were placed for each sub-category?
13. What is the total profit margin for each product?
14. Which seller has the highest number of unique customers?
15. How many orders were placed for each seller?
16. What is the total sales revenue generated per seller?
17. Determine the month with the highest number of orders.
18. What is the percentage contribution of each sub-category?
19. Which state has the highest total sales revenue?
20. What is the average price per unit for each product category?

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.
## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a SQL environment set up to execute queries.
3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data and derive insights.
5. Customize the analysis or queries as needed for your specific objectives.
## Conclusion
Through this project, I aim to provide valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer
preferences, and other factors influencing e-commerce operations. By analyzing the dataset
and addressing the key questions, I hope to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions
and optimizing their sales strategies.
